Overview:

After completing the initial development and testing phases, this day focuses on deploying the project live and ensuring it’s ready for public use. Post-launch practices will also be addressed to ensure smooth operation and continuous improvements.

Features:

Deployment to a cloud platform for public access (e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS).
Setting up production environment variables.
Basic monitoring and logging tools for tracking errors.
Initial user feedback collection.
Performance optimizations for faster loading times.
SEO and analytics setup.
Tech Stack:

Frontend: [e.g., Next.js, React]

Backend: [e.g., Node.js, Express.js, Sanity]

Database: [e.g., MongoDB, Firebase]

Cloud Platform: [e.g., Vercel, Netlify, AWS]

Tools: TypeScript, Git, VS Code, Docker (optional for containerization)

Objectives:

Deploy the project to a cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS).
Set up environment variables for production (e.g., API keys, database credentials).
Implement basic monitoring for application health (e.g., Sentry for error tracking, Google Analytics).
Test deployment for functionality across different devices and browsers.
Implement basic SEO strategies (e.g., meta tags, sitemap generation).
Conduct initial load testing to ensure the platform can handle traffic.
Plan for regular post-launch updates and bug fixes.
Installation:

To deploy the project live:

Set up a GitHub repository (if not already done).
Connect the repository to the cloud platform (e.g., Vercel, AWS).
Push the latest changes to the repository.
Configure the necessary production environment variables in the cloud platform dashboard.
Deploy the project and monitor the deployment process for errors.
Ensure the application is running correctly in the production environment.
To manage post-launch practices:
